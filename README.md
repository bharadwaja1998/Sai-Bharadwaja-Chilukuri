I achieved the implementation of DevOps best practices, leading to a 20% reduction in system downtime by Creating a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins that pipeline should automatically build, test, and deploy a sample application to a staging environment, followed by an automated deployment to production upon approval.

And also achieving a 25% reduction-- building a security-focused DevOps pipeline integrating security tools like SonarQube to automatically scan the code for vulnerabilities during the CI/CD process.

Elevated the success rate of continuous integration pipelines to 95% by implementing automated testing suites, reducing the number of defects in releases.
Improved collaboration between development and operations teams, and faster release cycles.

Monitoring daily builds using CI tool Jenkins.

Creating Docker images and Docker files as per requirement.
